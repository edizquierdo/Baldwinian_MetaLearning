# Baldwinian MetaLearning

Combining evolution (evolutionary algorithms) with lifetime learning (backprop) in neural networks to demonstrate MetaLearning for free and to better understand it.

This is an extension to the work by Finn, Abbeel, and Levine <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400v3">"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks (MAML)"</a> (2017) and by Fernando et al., "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07917">Meta-Learning by the Baldwin Effect</a>" (2019). This is work in progress and it will be published in the summer of 2022.
